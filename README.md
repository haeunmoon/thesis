Always run this before you make any new changes:
```
git pull
```

Adding any changes:
```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "whatever change you made"
git push
```

```
write all of the results at once (add a catch to tell if the results are already created to overwrite)
fix the numbering on the graphs
figure out what's happening with the blank q resuts
```
